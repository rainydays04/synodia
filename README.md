Synodia is a visual novel made using Ren'Py for Hack Club's Athena Award capstone, the Parthenon 36-hour hackathon. Based on a handful of goddesses from different mythologies, representing the "Parthenon Patrons," the story follows a journey with ten goddesses through three historic settings: an art museum, a weapons storage, and a strategy room. Find out whether you are a scholar, a soldier, or a ruler through your conversations with these supernatural beings.
