# Description
Synodia is the Greek word for "company of travels" - but where will *you* travel? Based on a handful of goddesses from different mythologies, representing the "Parthenon Patrons," Synodia follows a journey with ten goddesses through three historic settings: an art museum, a weapons storage, and a strategy room. Find out whether you are a scholar, a soldier, or a ruler through your conversations with these supernatural beings.
